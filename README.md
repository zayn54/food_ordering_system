This GitHub repository offers a command-line food ordering system under development. It currently allows users to order through text commands and saves them for tracking in an Excel file. While this serves as a foundational tool for developers, the project aims to evolve into a full-fledged restaurant kiosk system with a graphical interface, dynamic menus, and integrated payment processing.The system is still in beta, if you have ways of improving the system,I will really appreciate it.
